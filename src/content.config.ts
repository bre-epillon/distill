/**
 * Two collections, two node types:
 *
 *   sources — a book, article, or video you consumed. Carries provenance.
 *   notes   — one atomic idea. Carries meaning. This is what the graph draws.
 *
 * The split matters: a graph of sources gives you a handful of fat nodes and
 * vague edges. A graph of notes gives you a thinking tool. Sources only ever
 * differ in how you cite them (page / timestamp / URL) — never in note shape,
 * which is what lets a video note and a book note connect as equals.
